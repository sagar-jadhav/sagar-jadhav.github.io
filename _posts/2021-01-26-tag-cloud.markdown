## Introduction

Labeling a Cloud Resource in `key:value` format is known as Tagging. Labels should contain meaningful information. For e.g. To mark the `EC2` instance as a production environment you can tag it with the label `env:prod`.

## Types of Tagging

### I. Automated Tagging

Automated Tagging is a method of adding machine-generated Tag to Cloud Resource at the time of provisioning. You can use Automated Tagging in case of provisioning a Cloud Resource through an automation tool like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

**Examples:**

- `user:sagar`: A user who provisioned the Cloud Resource. 
- `timestamp:06/01/22 04:11:05`: Time of provisioning.
- `id:12456`: Unique identifier of the Cloud Resource.
- `group:finance`: A group that owns the Cloud Resource.

### II. Manual Tagging

Manual Tagging is a method of adding Tag manually to Cloud Resource at the time of provisioning. You can use Manual Tagging in case of provisioning a Cloud Resource through UI.

**Examples:**

- `purpose:poc`: The purpose behind provisioning a Cloud Resource.
- `env:prod`: Name of the environment where the Cloud Resource is provisioned.
- `cleanup:yes`: Delete a Cloud Resource after certain days. 

## Tagging Best Practices

- Use a small case.
- Don't use any special character especially `@`.
- Use underscore `_` instead of space.

## Why Tag a Cloud Resource?

- To group Cloud Resources. For e.g. If an application has multiple Cloud Resources then you can tag them with the label `app:myapp`.
- To delete Cloud Resources after certain days. For e.g. You can implement a policy that Cloud Resources will be automatically deleted after 7 days If they are tagged with a `cleanup:yes` label.
- For audit purposes. For e.g. You can generate a User per Cloud Resource report i.e How many Cloud Resources are owned by a particular User? By looking at the `owner:sagar` Tag.

## Demo

Let us understand Automated & Manual Tagging through the following examples:

### Add `timestamp` tag to EC2 instance through Terraform

In this example, you will learn How to add the `timestamp` tag to the EC2 instance through [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) at the time of provisioning. Check out [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs) to configure AWS connection before proceeding with the below steps.

I. Create a file called `main.tf` and add the below content to it

```
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "m1.small"

  tags = {
    Name = "automatedtaggedvm"
    timestamp = "${timestamp()}"
  }
}
```

II. Run `terraform init` command

III. Run `terraform plan` command

IV. Run `terraform apply` command

V. Verify EC2 instance provisioned with `timestamp` Tag

### Add `env` tag to EC2 instance through AWS Console

In this example, you will learn How to add the `env` tag to the EC2 instance through AWS Console at the time of provisioning.

I. Login to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

II. Launch EC2 instance and add `env` Tag as follows:

III. Verify EC2 instance provisioned with `env` Tag

## Glossary

### Cloud Resource
A resource deployed in Cloud. For e.g. EC2 instance, SNS service, Managed Kubernetes Service, etc.

### Provision
A process of deploying or creating Cloud Resources in Cloud. For e.g. Launching EC2 instance in AWS.
