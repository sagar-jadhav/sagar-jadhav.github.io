![30 Minutes One to One Meeting on Career Growth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagar-jadhav/sagar-jadhav.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/webinar_30_minutes.png)

Due to COVID-19 pandemic most of us are forced to work from home in order to keep everyone safe & healthy. As working from home giving me an extra time & flexibility I have decided to use this extra time in helping community by scheduling daily 30 minutes one to one meeting.

I have scheduled meeting starting from 29th March to 30th April 2020.
