Kubernetes uses `Readiness` & `Liveness` probes to manage pod lifecycle. Readiness probe is used to determine whether pod is ready to accept the traffic or not and liveness probe is used to determine whether pod is functioning properly or not. Read more about them [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/). In this blog I am adding readiness & liveness probe to PHPMyAdmin application.

### Architecture

![Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagar-jadhav/sagar-jadhav.github.io/master/static/img/_posts/kubernetes/4_arch.JPG)

### Prerequisites

- Deploy `PHPMyAdmin` Application.
Follow [Deploy phpMyAdmin application on kubernetes](https://developersthought.in/kubernetes/2020/05/30/k8s-session-01.html) blog.

- Go to `session_4` directory

  ```
  cd ../session_4/
  ```

**Step 1:** Delete `PHPMyAdmin` Deployment

```
kubectl delete deployment phpmyadmin
```

**Step 2:** Deploy `PHPMyAdmin` Deployment with **Readiness** & **Liveness** probes

```
kubectl create -f phpmyadmin-deployment.yaml
```

```
kubectl get pods --watch
```

Exit once pod goes into running state

**Step 3:** Browse phpmyadmin application

Go to browser and browse `http://IP_ADDRESS:30030`. Login with `root` user & `test` password. Here IP_ADDRESS is the ip address of virtual machine where kubernetes is running.
