## Introduction

Labeling a Cloud resource in `key:value` format is known as Tagging. Labels should contain meaningful information. For e.g. To mark the `EC2` instance as a production environment you can tag it with the label `env:prod`

## Types of Tagging

### I. Automated Tagging

Automated Tagging is a process of applying machine-generated Tag to resources at the time of provisioning. You can use it in case of provisioning a resource through an automation tool like [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

**Examples:**

- `user:sagar`: A user who provisioned the resource. 
- `timestamp:06/01/22 04:11:05`: Time of provisioning.
- `id:12456`: Unique identifier of the resource.
- `group:finance`: A group that owns the resource.

### II. Manual Tagging

In Manual Tagging, a Tag is applied manually to resources at the time of provisioning. You can use it in case of provisioning a resource through UI.

**Examples:**

- `purpose:poc`: The purpose behind provisioning a resource.
- `env:prod`: Name of the environment where the resource is provisioned.
- `cleanup:yes`: Delete a resource after certain days. 

## Tagging Best Practices

- Use a small case.
- Don't use any special character especially `@`.
- Use underscore `_` instead of space.

## Why Tag a Cloud resource?

- To group resources. For e.g. If an application has multiple resources then you can tag them with the label `app:myapp`.
- To delete resources after certain days. For e.g. You can implement a policy that resources will be automatically deleted after 7 days If they are tagged with a `cleanup:yes` label.
- For audit purposes. For e.g. You can generate a User per Resource report i.e How many resources are owned by a particular User? By looking at the `owner:sagar` Tag.

## Demo

Let us understand Automated Tagging & Manual Tagging through the following examples:

### Provision EC2 instance through Terraform

In this example, you will learn How to apply the `timestamp` tag to the EC2 instance through [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). Check out [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs) to configure AWS connection before proceeding with the below steps.

I. Create a file called `main.tf` and add the below content to it

```
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }

  owners = ["099720109477"] # Canonical
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "m1.small"

  tags = {
    Name = "systemtaggedvm"
    timestamp = "${timestamp()}"
  }
}
```

II. Run `terraform init` command

III. Run `terraform plan` command

IV. Run `terraform apply` command

V. Verify EC2 instance provisioned with `timestamp` Tag

### Provision EC2 instance through AWS Console

In this example, you will learn How to apply the `env` tag to the EC2 instance through AWS Console.

I. Login to [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)

II. Launch EC2 instance and tag `env` Tag as follows:
